	You fight valiantly, 

		but one of the monsters claws manages to slip through your defenses

			You feel the dull point rake across your neck 

				Your hot blood spills out, 

		You feel extraordinarily light 
	As the world grows dark

			You fall to the ground, 

							But you never feel the impact. 

		
												YOU ARE DEAD
