You run and run

.
.
The stench fades, 
The terrain becomes less muddy 

Soon you realize you are free of the swamp! 

you emerge on a large road.

A mysterious figure aproaches. 

They stop in front of you,
and hold out a small package. 

You take the package 
and open it slowly

inside is a HEALTH POTION! 

you quickly drain the contents,
and feel your wounds close almost instantly

you look up to thank the mysterious stranger,
but they are gone. 


You see a large city on the southern horizon
