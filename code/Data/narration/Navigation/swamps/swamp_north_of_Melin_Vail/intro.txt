	You enter the swamp.

		All around you is mud. 

		The sun rises higher in the sky	
		The air grows hot and sticky 

		The foul smell of rot hangs everywhere 

			Your feet make sickening sucking sounds 
			Every time you lift a foot from the muck 

			You grow tired 
			But you continue 

				Your foot gets stuck in the mud!
 
			You pull and pull, but your foot will not budge. 

			The stink of rot grows stronger
			
	You hear a growl behind you

	A small troll apears from behind a group of bushes and heads towards you
