Begin your journey

Darkness . . .

Darkness . . .

You hear the sound of the waves

You smell the salty smell the sea . . .

You awaken to find yourself 
on the cool sandy beach 
of some remote part of the world.

You try to think, 
but you cannot remember what brought you to this place. 

The sand feels cool against your bare feet. 

Just then you notice you are not wearing any shoes. 

The sound of gulls can be heard on the breeze as it brushes your face.

A shiver runs down your back, you are cold. 

Just off the beach there is a vast forest

There is a path which runs east into the trees 

You can: 
Walk down the path,
Walk north along the shore, 
Walk south along the shore, 
Or enter the water.
