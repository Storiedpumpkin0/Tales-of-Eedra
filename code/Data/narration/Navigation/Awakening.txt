							Begin your journey

						
	Darkness . . .

		Darkness . . .

		
					. . .the sound of the waves
	
					. . . the salty smell the sea . . .


					You awaken to find yourself 
					on the cool sandy beach 
					of some remote part of the world.

					You try to think, 
					but you cannot remember what brought you to this place. 


					The sound of gulls can be heard on the breeze as it brushes your face.

					A shiver runs down your back, you are cold. 

					Just off the beach there is a vast forest

					There is a path which runs east into the trees 

					You can: 
						Walk down the path,
						Walk north along the shore, 
						Walk south along the shore, 
						Or enter the water.
