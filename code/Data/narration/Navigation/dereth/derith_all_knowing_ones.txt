You approach the ALL KNOWING ONES booth
-
As you approach you see
A tall pale man dressed long blue robes 

Upon seeing you approach, the man speaks: 
--- 
Good meeting traveler! 

I knew you would speak to me as soon as you entered this world.  

	I represent the library of the mighty
		ALL KNOWING ONES

We are actively seeking newcomers
To join our knowledge. 

You are destined to become great. 

	Would you not share your greatness,
	With us, 
	The ALL KNOWING ONES? 

Seek us out, our home lies beyond.

In lake town.

--- 
You walk away from the booth.
