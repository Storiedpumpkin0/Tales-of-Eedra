			You approach the ALL KNOWING ONES booth

			As you approach you see
			A tall pale man dressed long blue robes 

			Upon seeing you approach, the man speaks: 
					--- 
				Good meeting traveler! 

				I knew you would speak to me as soon as you entered this world.  

				I represent the library of the mighty
				ALL KNOWING ONES

				We are actively seeking newcomers
				To join our knowledge. 

				You are destined to become great. 

				Would you not share your greatness?
				
					The ALL KNOWING ONES
					would love for you to 
					gain from us as well. . .

				Seek us out, our home lies beyond.

				In lake town.

					--- 
			
			you walk away from the booth.
