You approach the theater 

The doors are heavy,
But swing open as soon as you touch them 

Inside everything is dark 

You enter a short hallway 

The hallway opens into a large round room 
With many rows of seats 
And a small stage in the front

--- 
Hello there newcomer! 
--- 
You hear from behind you 

--- 
			Lost are you? 
	
	Or have you decided to trespass into my theater 
	On purpose? 

Ha Ha Ha, 
I am only kidding child! 

I can see by the dumb look on your face
That this is just an accident. 

		You need not be afraid. 

	My name is 
Bright Thestral 
	And this is my theater! 

However, 
my troupe is not offering any 
performances at this time. 

Please, leave us to our practice. 

Oh, and next time
 I may not believe your innocence 
in barging into our home. 

--- 
You leave the theater
