You investigate the burned buildings 
--- 

There are the remains of six houses 
All mostly burned to the ground

The smell of smoke 
Hangs heavily around the crumbling ash

One of the buildings looks different than the others, 
 
You look closer at this building, 
You see several ruined books 
Poking out of the soot

You pick up one of the books
But the pages are too damaged to read. 
---
You return to town
