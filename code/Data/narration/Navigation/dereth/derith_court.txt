	you choose to enter the court house. 
		 
	as you approach the court house 
	you admire the beautiful old world craftsmanship. 

	The doors are large and dark, 
	and make a loud creek as they are pushed open.

	Inside you find an empty room with many seats, 
	and one large seat high above the rest

	Sitting in the tallest chair
	is a small old man with long curly white hair.

	He looks surprised that you are here. 

		He says:
			---
			Excuse me
 
				What are you doing here? 

			Do you need legal assistance? 
	
			no?
  
			Well then, why are you here?
			
				I suppose I should introduce myself. 

					My name is Kurth Governmore
				and I am the high judge here in Derith. 

			This courthouse is 
			the primer center for 
			legal affairs 
			in all of the land!

			I am sorry, 
				but unless you are in legal trouble
				there is nothing in here for you. 

			Please,
 			enjoy our small town! 

			   and stay away from that man 
			claiming to be
		
				ALL KNOWING 

 					Something is not quite right there. . .
