you walk down the path and find yourself in a city 


you see an archway which reads
.

WELCOME TO DERITH

.
This town seems small, 
with only a few larger buildings. 

The air smells fresh, 
the breeze fills your nostrils.

In this town you see:

Several burned buildings to the east

A large court house to the west

An inn to the south west 

A small theater near the courthouse. 

a small booth with a sign that reads:
   JOIN THE ALL KNOWING ONES

There are several roads leading out of the city. 

To the north are two paths: 
One leading to Ku Belenor 
One leading to Fay

To the south is a path leading to Way
