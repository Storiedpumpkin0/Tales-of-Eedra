You struggle against the beasts mighty grasp,

But there is no way you can overcome 
The raw strength of the 
Powerful tentacles

You see the creatures razor sharp beak 
Coming right for you 

You lunge your head at the last moment, 
Causing the monster to sink its 
Terrible maw
 Into one of its own arms 

The beasts grasp fails for just a moment
Giving you the chance you needed to 
Escape 

You desperately swim for the shore 



The monster does not give chase 


You crawl back onto the beach
Wet, cold, and out of breath. 

But alive
