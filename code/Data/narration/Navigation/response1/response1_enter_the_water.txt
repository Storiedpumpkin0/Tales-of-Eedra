.

.
you enter
the 
water
.
.
.



The cool 
black 
surface
of the
water

barely parts
 
as you enter.
.
.
.
.

The dark
liquid 
seems to 
accept 
you
as you
 sink 
deeper

..
.
..
..
.
 
into the darkness.

.
.
.


You sink down 

.

Down 
..
.
.
..

Down 
.
..
.
..
.
..
.
..

Down 
..
..
.
...
.
...
.
..

You cannot breath, 
.
.

and yet you feel fine. 
.

.
.
.

All around is blackness.
.
.

.
Suddenly 
.
you see
 
a light 

before you! .


.

As your eyes adjust,
.
.

you realize 

this light is actually 

the large eye of

a colossal giant octopus! 
.
.
.

In an instant .

the light is gone
.

the octopus 
closes its massive tentacles
 around you. 


You Struggle to break free
