	You go North

	The beach stretches out before you.

	You walk around the gentile curves and rolling sand dunes 
	and feel the warmth of the sun on your right side. 

	You think to yourself
	It must be morning

	As you walk along you notice what looks like
	A large city on the horizon, away from the beach. 

	The water lies still to the west

	You can: 
 		  enter the CITY 
 
  		 enter the WATER
