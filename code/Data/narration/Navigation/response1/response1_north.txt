You go North

The beach stretches out before you.

You walk around the gentile curves and rolling sand dunes 
And feel the warmth of the sun on your right side. 

You think to yourself
It must be morning

As you walk along you notice what looks like
A large city on the horizon, away from the beach. 

The beach continues to stretch north 

The water lies still to the west

You can: 
   enter the CITY 
   Continue NORTH
   enter the WATER
