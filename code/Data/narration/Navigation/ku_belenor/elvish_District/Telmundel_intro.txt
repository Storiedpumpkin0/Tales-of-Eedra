You enter the old elvish district

	Not surprisingly 
	You see many elves going about their business
	
	Some notice you as you walk by
	And smile. 

	The elves here seem friendly 
	And ancient. 

	You are stopped by a  
	Tall, sturdy looking elf 
	With smooth tan skin and flowing golden hair 
	
	He introduces himself
	He speaks in a language you cannot understand,
	
	But you hear his voice in your mind
	As clearly as if he was speaking common
