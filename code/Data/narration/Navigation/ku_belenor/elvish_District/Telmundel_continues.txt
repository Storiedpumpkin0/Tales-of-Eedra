		What are you seeking here Ebrath?
	
		Adventure? 
		Mystery? 
		Excitement? 
		
			. . . Danger? 

			It just so happens that we have all here in Eerda 

			all In plenty I am afraid. . .

	People much like yourself 
	Have been going missing. 

	Beware, young Ebrath
	
	The ALL KNOWING 
		They are not who they seem to be. . .
