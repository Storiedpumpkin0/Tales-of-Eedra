	Telmundel looks down at you
	And smiles 

	He no longer moves his lips, 
	But you still hear his voice in your mind:
	
	 	--- 
	
		Your kin are normally
			Not welcome here. 

			I am older than the rest however, 
								And I can remember a time 	
							When the dwarves were very friendly 
							With the Nol-Relonel. 

					In fact, 
					The beautiful stonework 
					you see all around you 
					Was only possible thanks to 	
					The marvelous work 
				Of skilled Bronzebeard druids 
			From over the Serya mountains to the east

			Thank you for your visit 
				Good dwarf
