 
 
	you approach the city 

	As you draw near you see
	a large archway 
	reading

		WELCOME TO Ku BELENOR
 
	You attempt to enter the city, 
	but are stopped by the town guard. 

	He pauses a moment, 
	Looks you up and down
	Then says: 

		---
		Excuse me, 
		But I must ask your business. 

			Strange things have been happening
			Folks say

		You arent for that weird
				ALL KNOWING ONES 
		Nonsense, 

			Are you?

		--- 

	You make no response

	The guard responds: 

		---
		
		Ahh nevermind that. 

		I can see 
			you dont know nothing bout them anwhoo

				Enjoy Ku Belenor! 

			Oh, 
				and be sure to try somethin at the fish markets! 

		---
	
		You enter the city

		You see many people of 
		all races going about their business 

		Right before the gate 
		you see a comfortable looking building
		With a sign that reads: 
	
			COME ONE AND ALL 
			TO THE EVERYMAN INN


		Next to the inn are the market districts.

	West of the inn 
	is the old elvish district. 
		
		The buildings there are small 
		but elegant, 
		White walls with golden windows 
		and sparkling rooftops 


	Next to the elvish district 
	are the fish markets. 

		There you can see fish 
		of every color for sale

		Despite what you have heard
		 about fish markets, 

			There is no foul smell,
			The fish all look fresh and delicious,

	
	In the southeast corner of the town 
	stands a tall castle. 

		There is a sign out front reading: 

			GOVENORS PALACE

		There are tall walls all around 
		With a small array of armed guards out front. 


	In the northeast corner
 	are what look like slums
		The houses all look 
		dilapidated and disheveled. 
		The inhabitants, 
		all gaunt and dirty 

		
	Finally you notice a small booth 
		in-between the palace and the slums

			The booth has a banner which reads: 
		
						ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY
							ALL  	KNOWING   ONEES
