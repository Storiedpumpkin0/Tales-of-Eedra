 
 
you approach the city 

As you draw near you see
a large archway 
reading

	WELCOME TO Ku BELENOR
 
You attempt to enter the city, 
but are stopped by the town guard. 

He pauses a moment, 
Looks you up and down
Then says: 

---
Excuse me, 
	But I must ask your business. 

	Strange things have been happening
	Folks say

You aren’t for that weird
	ALL KNOWING ONES 
Nonsense, 

	Are you?

--- 

You make no response

The guard responds: 

---
Ahh nevermind that. 

	I can see 
	you don’t know nothing bout them anwhoo

Enjoy Ku Belenor! 

	Oh, 
	and be sure to try somethin at the fish markets!
