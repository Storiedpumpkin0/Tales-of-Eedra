	You notice this Halfling walking oddly close to you

	As you pretend not to notice,
	You watch as he gets closer and closer

	You feel a slight *tap* on backpack

	You turn quickly around 
	and grab the surprised Halfling by the throat

		---
			OH!! 		
				I . . .
						That . . .


		I AM SORRY SIR! 

		I poor and hungry and I . . .

		---

	You lock him in a dead stare

		---

		Ah okay. Ya got me. 

			If you let me go, I will tell you a secret. 

				You should seek out ARCHERS HOME in FORST


			There is a man there who can help train you in archery. . . 

		You may find yourself in need 
		And that may help . . .

		 --- 

	You let the Halfling go 

	Before you can blink he is out of site
