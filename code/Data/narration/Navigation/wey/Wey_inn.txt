				The common room is small, but cozy 

				A fire burns in a short hearth 

				You see a cheerful looking Halfling behind a desk
				in the corner of the room

						Hello Traveler! 

						Welcome to Wey

				We are a small town, but we all do our part

						
					You can stay if you like

			But Im afraid you wont find much company or conversation here

				
								We donâ€™t get many visitors 


						Enjoy our town!
