		You enter the ADVENTURE MARKET

		
		The door is old
		And so are many of the goods inside 

		Upon entering you are greeted by 
the smell of old books and dust


	---
	Hello there chap! 
			--- 

		An old man behind the counter greets you 

			---

	He hands you a small bottle with a 
	Blue glowing substance inside 

	You leave the shop 
		And you drink the bottle
